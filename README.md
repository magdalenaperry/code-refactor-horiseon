## Description

This is a homework assignment with a website housed on github. The purpose of the assignment was to refactor a marketing agency's website to comply with SEO guidelines and increase its accessibility. I updated non-semantic divs and spans into sections, articles, and other semantic elements. I also updated the CSS file to make it more DRY. 

## Visuals
These are the screenshots for the my refactored website.
