## Description

The Horiseon Solution Services, INC. website needed to comply with SEO guidelines and increase its accessibility. I updated non-semantic divs and spans into sections, articles, and other semantic elements. I also updated the CSS file to make it more DRY and updated image files to reduce page loading time. 

## Visuals
This is the final refactored website.
